<h2 id="c1">PREFACE</h2>
<p>Whose heart is not gladdened at the sight of the first <a href="#fTrailingArbutus">Mayflower or Arbutus</a> in the spring?
Who can pass a body of water, its surface glistening with the beauty of the <a href="#fWaterLily">Water Lily</a>, without
appreciation? In the fall who can traverse a field blind to the brilliancy of the seas of
<a href="#fAsters">Purple Asters</a> and gleams of the
<a href="#fGoldenRods">Goldenrod</a>? Yet it is only within a very few years that there has been
any real, concerted interest shown by the masses in Nature Study. To be sure, botany has long
been taught in some of the higher schools, but it was of advantage only to comparatively few.
Now the call for knowledge, or at least the name, of what is seen in their daily rambles is voiced
by tens of thousands.</p>
<p>Since the publication, early in 1906, of the first edition of Bird Guide, the author has been besieged
by requests from all parts of the country, and from people in every walk and station of life,
to continue the idea and bring out similar volumes on flowers, butterflies, fish, animals, etc. The
present volume has been carefully prepared with two objects always in view&mdash;to serve the greatest
number of persons in the best possible way&mdash;and still have a volume that can be carried in the
pocket with little or no discomfort. The great majority of the colored paintings have been made
directly from living plants, and the balance, with few exceptions, from herbarium specimens.
They represent normal specimens and have been so chosen as to include those of the conspicuous
flowering plants found from the Atlantic seaboard west to the States of the Mississippi Valley.
Using my 25 years, devoted largely to the study of living things, as a criterion, I have endeavored
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
to incorporate in the text and in the pictures just those points that will best serve to identify a
flower that the reader may find. The introductory pages give the life cycle of a plant from seed to
seed and many curious facts concerning curious plants.</p>
<p>Should this volume identify some of the flowers that the reader may discover, and give him a
clearer idea of the appearance and beauty of the growing things that may be found, the author&rsquo;s
purpose will have been fully accomplished.</p>

<h2 id="c2">INTRODUCTORY</h2>
<p>A plant is a wonderful organism, yet how few of us realize it as we casually glance at the
flowers growing by the wayside. We see a beautiful flower; we know that in the course of time it
withers and fades away; and we know that the next year the plant grows up again, sends forth its
buds, which at the proper time unfold their petals, and so the cycle continues year after year,
while we give little thought to the change that occurs, the cause and its effect. Volumes might be
written, and a great many have been since the time of Darwin, upon the many interesting processes
by which various flowers are propagated. As this book is confined chiefly to the identification
of flowers, we will give but a few illustrations between flowering seasons. We see in most flowers a
thing of beauty; their real and, to them, most important function is to produce seeds to perpetuate
the species.</p>
<p>The parts of a flower that are necessary to produce seeds are the pistil, with its stigma at the
top and ovule at the base, and the stamens with their pollen-laden anthers. A flower that has
these organs is known as a perfect flower; if, in addition, it has a corolla and calyx, or petals and
sepals, it is known as a complete flower. On the opposite page are shown a number of flowers with
their parts named.</p>

<img src="images/p008.jpg" alt="PARTS OF FLOWERS" width="500" height="281" />
<p class="center"><span class="small">PARTS OF FLOWERS</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">[9]</div>
<p>In order that seed may be set, it is necessary that ripened pollen from the anthers should come
in contact with the usually sticky stigma, whence it will be transmitted down the style and germinate
the ovule. As is well known to be the case with the higher animals, cross-fertilization is
necessary in order to insure a good, vigorous species. It is also evident that should the pollen continue
to fertilize the ovule in the same flower, the plants in successive generations might become
weakened and finally die out and the species be lost. To avoid such a calamity, flowers are constructed
so as to facilitate cross-fertilization and the means that some of them adopt towards insuring
that end are remarkable. The stamens on most of the simple flowers usually curve outwards,
so that the pollen-laden anthers are far enough removed so that there is little danger of the
pollen falling on the stigma, at least until after cross-fertilization has already taken place. Others
have either the anthers or stigma ripen first, so that it must necessarily be pollen from another
blossom that quickens the seed.</p>
<p>We all marvel at the industry of the honey bee; how tirelessly it buzzes from flower to flower,
from each gathering a drop of the nectar, with which it fills its cells; but we do not always realize
the double duty it is doing, for it is a most reliable and active agent for the propagations of a great
many plants. Many butterflies, bees, and even beetles unconsciously accomplish the same result,
and it is now conceded that each has special colors that are attractive to them. For instance, the
bumblebee has a strong preference for blues and purples. The observer will also notice that a bee
makes the rounds from flower to flower, taking all of one kind and passing by other species.
While this habit undoubtedly avoids some complications, even should he mix his drinks and visit
in succession flowers of widely different species, confusion would not be apt to result, for the stigma
of one species is usually not responsive to pollen brought from blossoms of another family.</p>
<p>Botanists go a step further; not content with the discovery that certain insects like certain
colors, they claim (and apparently with good reason) that the bright and showy petals are for the
sole purpose of attracting insects; they are, in fact, bill boards advertising the fact that there is a
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
store of honey there ready for the asking. On the other hand, those flowers that are self-fertilized
or wind-fertilized have inconspicuous blossoms.</p>
<p>The stigma always partially obstructs the entrance to the food supply, so that the visiting
bee must brush against it, and in doing so will leave some of the pollen that he has brought from
the last flower visited on its sticky surface. The pollen-dust is attached to the insect in various
ways, usually simply by his brushing against the anthers with his hairy body, for it is found that
nearly all the useful insects have downy or hairy bodies; other flowers set a sort of spring gun and
when the insect steps on the trigger he is showered with the germs (<a href="#fMountainLaurel">Laurel</a> for example); still
others have clefts to catch the legs of visitors, releasing them only if they are strong enough to tear
away the pollen masses (such a flower is well illustrated in the <a href="#fCommonMilkWeed">Milkweed</a>). Besides having bright
colored petals, many of the flowers also have a pleasing odor, this also serving to attract certain
kinds of insects; others have very unpleasant odors, like the <a href="#fSkunkCabbage">skunk-cabbage</a> or even like that of
putrid meat, as in the carrion flower and the <a href="#fPurpleTrillium">purple trillium</a>, these odors being apparently for the
purpose of attracting certain scavenger insects. There are also some flowers, like the <a href="#fEveningPrimrose">evening primrose</a>,
that are seen at their best after dusk, when the light-colored petals are widespread and a
delicate perfume given off to attract the moths and sphinges that visit them.</p>
<p>It is evident that a flower secreting honey may be visited by unwelcome guests, ones that will
accept of the nectar, but will make no useful return. Any insect with a shiny, smooth body
whether winged or not, is of little use in fertilizing a plant, for even should it receive pollen, it will
in all probability have fallen off before the next flower is visited. Ants being particularly fond of
sweet things and so small that they can enter a flower without disturbing the anthers, frequently
drain the nectar cups so no useful insect will visit them, and they fail to reproduce their kind.
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
Nature has a number of quite effective ways of preventing thefts of this kind, one of the most
common ways being to provide the plant stem with bristly hairs, forming a very difficult barrier for
any crawling insect to overcome; others have a tuft of hair at the very entrance to the honey cells
which bar the way for unwelcome guests, but readily allow the bee to insert its tongue; still others
are protected by recurved leaves or by sticky stems, or as in the <a href="#fToadflax">toadflax</a> by a two-lipped flower,
which will open under the weight of a bumblebee, but is effectively closed to any lighter insect.</p>
<p>The seeds, having been set, are enclosed in a capsule composed of the closed and dried sepals,
the petals having fallen off; in a pod as in the peas and beans; or in fruit, as inside an apple, which
is formed by the base of the flower enlarging about the seeds with the calyx remaining at the top of
the ripened fruit, or in the strawberry, where the seeds are on the outside of the berry and the
calyx at the bottom of the fruit. It is plain that should these seeds simply fall to the ground,
plants of a single species would soon become so crowded in a small area that the earth could not
support them. Consequently various means are furnished different plants for the dispersion of
their seeds. A great number, like the <a href="#fCanadaThistle">thistles</a>, <a href="#fCommonMilkWeed">milkweeds</a>
and <a href="#fFallDandelion">dandelions</a>, have plume-like parachutes
provided for each seed, so they can float away on the breeze to new fields; those that have
their seeds embedded in fruit are entrusted to birds to be carried where fate wills it; others, like
<a href="#fBeggarTicks">beggar-ticks</a>, <a href="#fBurdock">burdock</a>, etc., have spines to attach themselves to the clothing of people or to the
coats of animals that brush against them.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>As certain insects prey upon plants or rob them of their nectar, so certain plants prey upon
insects, literally eating them or absorbing them into their system. Best known among these are the
<a href="#fPitcherPlant">pitcher plants</a>, a swamp species, whose leaves are pitcher-like and with a hood or awning over the
top to keep out the rain; these leaves are half filled with a sweet fluid that attracts insects, makes
them tipsy and causes their death in the watery grave, the plant feeding largely upon the resulting
broth. Of another type is the <a href="#fRoundLeavedSundew">round-leaved sundew</a>, also a common plant; its leaves are covered
with short bristly hairs, a drop of gum glistening at the end of each. A fly investigating these is
soon caught in the sticky gum and the leaf slowly folds together, enveloping the victim in what
might be termed the stomach of the plant. Perhaps the most interesting and surely the most peculiar
plant is the Venus fly-trap, which is found only in eastern North Carolina. At the end of
each leaf is apparently a smaller one, perhaps an inch in diameter; this is fringed around the edge
and rather bristly in the centre. These central bristles are very sensitive and if touched or an
insect lights upon the leaf, the two parts of the leaf instantly clasp together on the central stem as
a hinge. If nothing is caught, in a short time the trap opens again; if, however, the attempt has
been successful it will remain closed for several days or a week, until the victim is entirely absorbed
by the glands on the inner surface of the leaf.</p>
<p>As in the animal world, so in the plant world; always a struggle for existence, the strong surviving
and the weak falling by the wayside. The old adage that &ldquo;In union there is strength&rdquo; is
amply proved by many of the composite flowers, such as the <a href="#fAsters">asters</a> and <a href="#fGoldenRods">goldenrods</a>, whose stalks
are not only capped with numerous flower-heads, but each flower-head is composed of hundreds of
little perfect florets, so closely set together that even should an insect but crawl across the flower-head
he will fertilize a number of them. That their plan is a good one is seen by the steady increase
in the numbers of these flowers and the rapid strides with which they occupy new territory.
On the other hand, compare such flowers as the <a href="#fYellowLadysSlipper">lady&rsquo;s slippers</a>, <a href="#fFringedGentian">fringed gentian</a> and numbers of
others that are yearly becoming less common.</p>

<br />(<i>Typhace&aelig;</i>)</h3>
<p class="genus">The members of this family are very abundant aquatic
herbs with perennial roots. We have two species with differences
as noted below. Both have staminate yellow flowers in a
spike above pistillate brown ones; the former soon fall or blow
away, while the latter develop into the large, familiar, brown
cat-tail that is often used for decorative purposes.</p>
<p class="genus">(A) <span class="sc">Common Cat-tail</span> (<i>Typha latifolia</i>) has yellowish
staminate flowers encircling the upper end of the flower stalk,
and immediately below a long cylindrical mass of brownish
pistillate ones. The pollen grains are arranged in fours.
Leaves three to eight feet long, sheathing at the base. Found
in marshes throughout the United States and southern Canada,
flowering in June and July.</p>
<p class="genus">(B) <span class="sc">Narrow-leaved Cat-tail</span> (<i>Typha angustifolia</i>) has

<h3 class="ffamily">BUR REED FAMILY
<br />(<i>Sparganiace&aelig;</i>)</h3>
<p class="genus">The Bur Reeds are marsh-inhabitating plants, some growing
along the muddy shores of ponds or streams, while other
species are strictly aquatic, growing in the water with floating
leaves. Like the <a href="#fCatTailFamily">Cat-tails</a> they are not in the least dependent
upon insects for fertilization. The two kinds of flowers, staminate
and pistillate, are always in separate spherical clusters
usually alternately arranged along the stem.</p>
<p class="genus">(A) <span class="sc">Great Bur Reed</span> (<i>Sparganium eurycarpum</i>) is stout and
erect, two to three feet in height. The mature heads, or fruit,
about one inch across; composed of wedge-shaped nutlets
arranged in the form of a sphere. The basal leaves are similar
to those of the <a href="#fCatTailFamily">Cat-tail</a> and clasp the stems. These plants are
found in the whole of the U.S. and southern Canada, flowering
from June to August.</p>
<p class="genus">(B) <span class="sc">Branching Bur Reed</span> (<i>S. androcladum</i>) throws off

<p class="genus"><span class="sc">Genus Arrow-head</span> (<i>Sagittaria</i>). Arrow-heads or Sagittarias
are among our most beautiful water plants. The leaves
vary greatly in shape but are always graceful in appearance.
All species have three pure white petals with a golden centre
formed by the large anthers. They usually grow in the water
but sometimes on the muddy shores, and flower in June.</p>
<p class="genus">(A) <span class="sc">Broad-leaved Arrow-head</span> (<i>Sagittaria latifolia</i>) has
broad, arrow-shaped leaves on long petioles from the root. The
3-petalled white flowers grow in whorls of three, the upper ones
being staminate and the lower pistillate. Seed, winged on
both edges and with a twisted horizontal beak. This species
is smooth, but a variety (pubescens) has the stem quite wooly.
Common in the whole of our range.</p>
<p class="genus">(B) <span class="sc">Narrow-leaved Arrow-head</span> (<i>S. Engelmanniana</i>) has

<br />(<i>Arace&aelig;</i>)</h3>
<p class="genus">This is quite a large family of plants containing six genera.
All have acrid or pungent juices; flowers closely crowded on a
spadix, usually surrounded by a spathe; leaves either simple or
compound and of various shapes.</p>
<h3 class="fgenus"><b>Genus</b> (<i>Aris&aelig;ma</i>)</h3>
<p class="genus"><span class="sc">Jack-in-the-Pulpit or Indian Turnip</span> (<i>Aris&aelig;ma triphyllum</i>)
is the most abundant and the best-known representative of
this genus. In moist woods you will find Jack, represented
by the spadix, looking out at you from his pulpit, represented
by the spathe of the flower. The spathe is light green, more or
less striped with brown, especially on the inside; the spadix is
also green and has the tiny flowers clustered about its base.
The large solid roots are very acrid and fiery to the taste, but
are said to have been relished by the Indians. Usually two,
thrice-compounded leaves spread shelteringly on long stems
over the flower spathe. Large clusters of bright berries remain
after the leaves have withered. Flowers throughout
U. S. from April to July.</p>

<p class="genus">(A) <span class="sc">Water Arum</span> (<i>Calla palustris</i>) is our only representative
of its genus. It is quite a common plant in cool bogs, where it
grows from six inches to a foot in height. The beautiful dark
green heart-shaped leaves stand above the water on long
petioles. A beautiful, waxy-white, spreading spathe is often
mistaken for the flower. The true flowers are small and perfect,
clustered at the end of a yellow spadix. The flowering
season is in June. You may find this plant commonly in cool
bogs from N. J. and Mo. northward.</p>
<p class="genus">(B) <span class="sc">Golden Club</span> (<i>Orontium aquaticum</i>) is also our
only member of its genus. As you will see by the opposite
picture, there is no protective spathe for the golden floral
club.</p>
<p class="genus">The florets are complete, having six sepals and stamens; they
are set closely on the swollen spadix and attract many flies and
even water snails that cross-fertilize them simply by crawling
over the clubs.</p>
<p class="genus">The leaves of the Golden Club are pointed oblong in shape,
floating on the surface of the water by means of long stems from
the perennial rootstalk. Flowers in May from Mass. to Fla.
and westward.</p>

<p class="genus">The common <span id="fSkunkCabbage" class="sc">Skunk Cabbage</span> (<i>Symplocarpus f&oelig;tidus</i>) although
regarded by many only with disgust, has one claim that
cannot be disputed, that of being our first flower to bloom each
year. It is not uncommon to find them with the shell-like
spathe above ground and the pollen fully ripened even in January,
although from the latter part of February to the first of
May is the usual flowering season.</p>
<p class="genus">The flower spathes show a great diversity of coloring according
to their age, ranging from a pale green sparingly streaked
with brown to an almost solid purple tone.</p>
<p class="genus">The flowers are small, perfect, and closely crowded on the
thick fleshy spadix, concealed or partially so by the large, thick
purple and green stained hood. The leaves appear after the
flower has withered or commenced to do so; they are bright
green, large, cabbage-like and strongly veined; quite handsome,
in fact. These plants range from N. S. to Minn., and
southward, chiefly in boggy ground.</p>

of our native plants having pure blue flowers. Each blossom
lasts but a single day.</p>
<p class="genus">The stem is rather weak, much jointed, and attains heights of
one to two feet. Two petals are large, rounded and blue, while
the third is tiny and colorless; the whole flower peeps out from a
clasping, cordate, heart-shaped leaf or spathe. Found from
southern Mass. to Mich. and southward, blooming in rich
woods or dooryards from June to Sept.</p>
<p class="genus">(B) <span class="sc">Spiderwort</span>; <span class="sc">Job&rsquo;s Tears</span> (<i>Tradescantia virginiana</i>),
like the Day Flower, remains open for but part of a day, after
which the petals contract into glutinous drops.</p>
<p class="genus">The stem is hairy and sticky; from one to two feet high.
Three purple petals, three brown, hairy sepals and six orange-tipped
stamens compose the flowers. They may be found in

abundant water plant, growing profusely in shallow ponds or
along the edges of fresh-water streams, and flowering from June

<p class="genus">The flowers grow on a spike that proceeds from a small,
green, leaf-like spathe; the 3 upper divisions of the 6-parted
perianth are partially united, but the 3 lower ones are spreading;
they are a light violet-blue with two yellow spots at the
base of the upper united parts. A single heart-shaped, cordate
leaf clasps the stem about midway, while others on long
petioles grow from the rootstalk. Commonly found from
N. S. to Manitoba and southward.</p>
<p class="genus">(B) <span class="sc">Mud Plantain</span> (<i>Heteranthera reniformis</i>) has a slender,
few-flowered spike proceeding from a small sheath-like spathe.

species in our range, divided into 33 genera.</p>
<p class="genus">(A) <span class="sc">Bellwort</span> (<i>Uvularia perfoliata</i>) is common in rich woods.
The stem, reaching a length of 6 to 18 in., rises from a short
rootstalk. A single, straw-colored flower is pendent from the
end of each drooping branch; it is long, bell-shaped, and has six
narrow divisions. The leaves are light green, lance-shaped, and
pierced by the stem. The slightly fragrant flowers are so concealed
by their drooping position as to be invisible from above.
They blossom in May and June throughout the U. S.</p>
<p class="genus">(B) <span class="sc">Oakesia</span>; <span class="sc">Wild Oats</span> (<i>Oakesia sessifolia</i>) has an angular
stem from 6 to 14 in. long. The ovate-lanceolate leaves are
seated on the stem and not pierced by it. The one or two
flowers are similar in size and coloring to those of Bellwort but
the interior is smooth while the latter has rough ridges. This
species is common from Me. to Minn. and southward.</p>

<h3 class="ffamily">ONION; GARLIC
<br /><b>Genus</b> (<i>Allium</i>)</h3>
<p class="genus">The various species belonging to this genus are very strongly
scented, pungent herbs growing from a coated bulb.</p>
<p class="genus">(A) <span class="sc">Wild Leek</span>; <span class="sc">Wild Onion</span> (<i>Allium tricoccum</i>) is a woodland
plant blooming in May and June. The flowers are in an
umbel at the top of a scape 6 to 20 in. high. The flower
perianth is divided into six greenish-white sepals. The leaves
are oblong-lance-shaped, pointed at both ends, on long petioles
from the bulbous root, but usually withering before the
flowers appear. Found from N. B. to Minn. and southward.</p>
<p class="genus">(B) <span class="sc">Wild Garlic</span> (<i>Allium canadense</i>) has few purplish
6-parted flowers on slender pedicels from a cluster of bulblets
at the top of a scape 10 to 24 in. high. The leaves are grass-like,
sheathing the stem above the fibrous bulb. Flowers in
May and June in moist meadows, from N. B. to Mich. and
southward.</p>

<p class="genus"><span class="sc">Day Lily</span> (<i>Hemerocallis fulva</i>) (<span class="sc">European</span>) will, we think,
prove a welcome addition to our flora. It is now locally
abundant in R. I., Conn., and N. Y. It flourishes best near
salt water and spreads rapidly by means of its running roots as
well as by seed. The flower stalk is tall, 2 to 5 feet, and at its
summit bears eight or nine buds which open one or two a day
into large showy flowers.</p>
<p class="genus">The perianth is funnel-form, with six spreading orange
limbs and six long stamens with large brown anthers. The
blossoms appear in July and August, each remaining open for
but a single day; this habit makes them very popular for vase
flowers as the number of buds on each stalk insures fresh
flowers every day for a week or more. The leaves are long and
linear, similar to those of the <a href="#fCatTailFamily">Cat-tail</a>, appearing from a fleshy
perennial rootstalk at the base of the tall flower scape.</p>
<p class="genus">In the absence of any odor, the beautiful flower cup serves
to attract the bees that are necessary for the setting of its seed.</p>

<p class="genus">All the members of this genus are among our most beautiful

recognized because their perianth, or flower funnel, always
opens upward.</p>
<p class="genus"><span class="sc">Wood Lily</span>; <span class="sc">Wild Orange-red Lily</span> (<i>Lilium philadelphicum</i>)
has a leafy stem 1 to 3 feet high, at its summit bearing one
to four erect (not pendulous) flowers; the divisions of the perianth
are deep orange-red, lightening in color at the stem-like
bases and profusely spotted with dark brown; the outside of the
perianth is dull whitish green. The leaves are lanceolate,
sharply pointed at each end and whorled about the stem in
groups of from three to seven. Its name is rather misleading
for, while it is sometimes found in woods, it will be found
blooming most profusely in sandy or brush-covered land.
Blooms in July and August in sandy soil from N. E. to Mich.

<p class="genus"><span id="fTurksCapLily" class="sc">Turk&rsquo;s-cap Lily</span> (<i>Lilium superbum</i>) is a most beautiful
plant, prolific in bloom almost beyond belief, sometimes containing
from thirty to forty brilliant orange flowers. The
bright sepals are always reflexed, sometimes so much so that
they remind one of a coiled spring. One has but to touch the
large pendent anthers to get a practical demonstration of how
the pollen is attached to the body of a bee and carried to another
flower, there to be deposited on the sticky stigma of the
mature style. Naturally a species so prolific of flower and so
capable of being cross-fertilized by foreign agency is in little
danger of having its numbers lessened.</p>
<p class="genus">The flowers, nodding at the top of a stem ranging from 2 to 7
feet in height, have a six-parted perianth, orange-red, thickly
spotted with purplish brown. The lanceolate leaves are
crowded along the upper stem and whorled about its lower

invitingly and seeming fairly to tinkle in the bright sunlight.
On the whole, this flower may be regarded as more graceful in
form than is the <a href="#fTurksCapLily">Turk&rsquo;s-cap</a>, but it cannot compare with the
latter flower for beauty of coloring. The regular whorled
leaves and graceful bending peduncles supporting the hanging
&ldquo;bells&rdquo; make a conventional design that often appeals to the

<p class="genus">The flowers are in terminal clusters of one to twelve blossoms,
nodding on long peduncles from the summit of tall leafy

often locally known as the &ldquo;Trout Lily&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Fawn Lily,&rdquo;
both of which names are far more appropriate than those given
it generally.</p>
<p class="genus">The single 6-parted flower grows at the top of a scape from 5

at its base, near the scaly bulb; they are pale green, mottled
with purple and white. This species blooms in April and May

<p class="genus"><span class="sc">Purple Twisted-stalk</span> (<i>Streptopus roseus</i>) has, as would be
judged from its name, a very angular or twisted stem. At each
angle or joint appears an ovate-lanceolate, cordately ribbed,
shining green leaf, seated on the stem. From the axils of the
terminal leaves appear small flowers on slender, thread-like
peduncles; these flowers are sometimes single or, again, in
pairs; they have a bell-shaped base and the perianth is divided
into six lanceolate, spreading dull purple sepals. The stem,
which is rather sparingly bristly hairy, reaches heights of 1 to
2&frac12; feet. This rosy species blooms in May and June in cold
moist woods from Newfoundland to Manitoba and southward
to the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p class="genus"><span class="sc">Common Twisted-stalk</span> (<i>Streptopus amplexifolius</i>) is

throughout northern United States and the southern half of
Canada.</p>

bell-shaped flowers about one half inch in length, hanging in
pairs on slender peduncles from the axils of the leaves. The
stem is 1 to 2 feet in height. The oblong-lanceolate leaves
alternate along, and are partly seated on, the stem; deep green
above and glaucous or whitish below. Very common in woods
from N. B. to Ont. and southward, flowering from April to
June.</p>
<p class="genus">These plants receive their name from the thick, fleshy, and
knotted rootstalks. They are perennials, each year throwing
up new stalks; after flowering these wither away and leave
pronounced scars on the roots. These scars suggested the
name of Solomon&rsquo;s Seal and the number of them probably
accurately denotes the ages of the plants. Both the large and
the small species grow in the same localities. They can readily
be distinguished by comparison, for commutatum is always
larger in all its parts; while it may be but a foot and a half tall
it will be stouter and have comparatively larger flowers than its
relative. Often it assumes truly gigantic size and may tower
above a tall man&rsquo;s head.</p>

woodland plant, but the flowers are so inconspicuous that they
are often overlooked; in fact they are often nodding below the
upper leaves so as to be invisible. The stem is tall and slender,
ranging from 1 to 3 feet in height; it rises from a thick horizontal
rootstalk, having a taste similar to that of the cucumber.
A whorl of from five to nine ovate-lanceolate, pointed leaves is
located midway on the stem; at the top, three smaller but
similarly shaped leaves radiate. Above these, or it may be below,
because of the curving pedicels, are three flowers. They

<p class="genus">Trilliums derive their generic name from the fact that all
their parts are arranged in threes; three leaves, three petals,
three sepals, and a three-parted stigma. The common name of
Wake Robin was probably early given because these flowers
appear at an early date. As a matter of fact they do not bloom
until weeks after the robins have returned to the Northern
States. All the purple trilliums have an unpleasant odor resembling
that of putrid meat; as they are largely dependent for
fertilization upon certain carrion flies, it is very probable that
their peculiar color is for the purpose of an added lure for these
insects.</p>

colonies and it is an exception when one finds a single plant
without others being in sight. The stem of this species is from
10 to 18 inches in height; the waxy-white petals are from 1&frac12; to
2 in. in length; as they grow older the color changes to a delicate
pink and they curve gracefully backward.</p>
<p class="genus">The flower is on a short pedicel above the whorl of broad,

swaying above the deep green background formed by their
broad, whorled leaves. They grow most profusely along the
banks of woodland brooks and in cool, moist glens. You will
find them most abundant during the latter part of May soon
after the wood thrush, that frequents the same locality,
makes his appearance from the South. They are always associated
in my mind with these birds and with water thrushes
that I have often watched as they daintily threaded their way
among the numerous plant stalks, entirely concealed above by
the numerous leaves, and visible only by placing the head
close to the ground.</p>

golden stars peering at us from a background of green grass.
So closely do the leaves of this little plant correspond to the

to distinguish them. The blossoms are visited by
several of the smaller bees for pollen; some of this is often unwittingly
carried to the sticky stigma of the next flower visited
and cross-fertilization effected.</p>

frame through, but at length he succeeds and the aperture
closes behind him. After eating his fill he takes the easiest way
out, toward the base where he can see two spots of light. As
he forces his way through the narrow passage he comes in contact
with a sticky stigma, armed with incurving hairs which remove
any pollen he may have on his back; as he continues his
struggle out he reaches an anther blocking the passage and
waiting to clap its load of pollen on his back.</p>

long, linear, with the edges rolled or folded together; the
petals are oblong-lanceolate and purple; the lip is also purple,
wedge-shaped, three-lobed and with a hairy crest, down the

The four to twelve flowers are loosely racemed at the top of the
scape which is from 5 to 10 in. high. The magenta-pink petals
and sepals are united to form a hood; the lip, curving abruptly
downward, is broadly ovate and white; each flower has a short
spur and is bracted. This species is found throughout the

form a hood. It is found in the whole of the U. S., flowering in
July and August.</p>
<p class="genus">(B) <span class="sc">Ladies Tresses</span> (<i>Spiranthes cernua</i>) is so named because

<p class="genus">(A) <span class="sc">Heart-leaved Twayblade</span> (<i>Listera cordata</i>) belongs to
a genus containing five species.</p>
<p class="genus">Like most of the orchids, they are largely or wholly dependent
upon insect aid for fertilization. The weight or shock of
an alighting insect on the broad lip causes a small gland within
the flower to rupture and cover the pollen, just below, with a
sticky fluid that causes it to adhere to the head or body of the
insect and thus be transferred to the next flower.</p>
<p class="genus">The stem of this species is from 3 to 10 in. high. At the top
is a few-flowered raceme; the sepals and petals are similar and
spreading; the lip is drooping, longer, two-cleft and madder-purple
in color. This species flowers during June and July in
swampy woods from N. J. to Colo. and northward to the
Arctic coast.</p>

<br />(<i>Aristolochiace&aelig;</i>)</h3>
<p class="genus">A small family of low herbs or twining vines, with but two
genera and few species.</p>
<p class="genus"><span class="sc">Wild Ginger</span> (<i>Asarum canadense</i>) may be found flowering
in rich woods during April and May, from Me. to Mich. and
southward. It has two large, heart-shaped leaves on long
petioles from the base; deep green above and lighter below,
soft, wooly, and handsomely veined.</p>
<p class="genus">The leaves are very beautiful, but it is the solitary flower
that makes this plant so interesting. Small, dully colored, on a
weak, short stem that barely raises it above ground and often
leaves it concealed by the dead leaves that carpet the woods in
early spring.</p>
<p class="genus">The flower is bell-shaped, with three short, sharply-pointed
spreading lobes; six stamens with short anthers and a thick
style with six radiating stigmas. Another species (<i>grandiflorum</i>),
found in Va. and N. C., has but one leaf and flowers
twice as large, or two inches in length.</p>

<p class="genus"><span class="sc">Pipe Vine</span>; <span class="sc">Dutchman&rsquo;s Pipe</span> (<i>Aristolochia macrophylla</i>).
The Dutchman&rsquo;s Pipe is chiefly a southern plant or vine, being
found from Pa. and Minn. southward. It has a woody, climbing
stem that may attain lengths of from 10 to 40 feet. The
very large, deep-green, veiny leaves that alternate along the
stem are very beautiful. In the dull, greenish-yellow flowers,
however, lies the chief interest of the botanist. Its stigma
matures and withers away before the ripening of the pollen,
thus making the plant dependent upon insects for its perpetuation.</p>
<p class="genus">The throat is filled with tiny hairs, all pointing inward, so
ingress is easy but egress impossible. Entering insects are
held prisoners, living upon the nectar, until the stigma withers
and pollen ripens; after this the hairs in the throat lose their
rigidity and the pollen-dusted and well-fed prisoners are
allowed to escape. Their memories are poor or the pollen feast
is well worth the imprisonment, for they usually immediately
hie to another blossom and force their way in, of course
pollenizing the flower in so doing.</p>

<p class="genus">This family is divided into seven genera and many of these
are further divided. They are all inconspicuous in flower.
The genus Rumex, to which our common Sorrels belong, contain
seventeen species: that of Polygonum, which contains the

<p class="genus">(A) <span class="sc">Common Chickweed</span> (<i>Stellaria media</i>) (<span class="sc">European</span>).
Although this is an introduced weed, so hardy and prolific is it
that probably it now exceeds in numbers any of our indigenous
plants. It grows profusely about dooryards and along roadsides
everywhere. The corolla consists of five white, very
deeply cleft petals, and the calyx of the same number of larger
and longer green sepals. The leaves are ovate, small, opposite,
on small stems about the length of the leaves. The plant stem
is either simple or branched and ranges from 2 to 10 in. in
height.</p>
<p class="genus">(B) <span class="sc">Long-leaved Stitchwort</span> (<i>S. longifolia</i>) has larger
flowers than the last, but the petals are very narrow and so
deeply cleft as to appear to be ten in number instead of five.
The sepals are nearly but not quite as long as the petals. The
stem is weak and usually supported by surrounding grasses or
vegetation. The leaves are small, linear, and pointed at both
ends. Common everywhere in wet places.</p>

<p class="genus">(A) <span class="sc">Corn Cockle</span> (<i>Agrostemma githago</i>) (<span class="sc">European</span>). The
Corn Cockle is very closely related to the <a href="#fBladderCampion">Campions</a> (genus
Lychnis). It is an annual with an erect and rather downy
stem; it branches but slightly, each branch being terminated
by one or two large handsome magenta flowers with an expanse
of one to two inches. The calyx is densely hairy, as are also
the lanceolate leaves that grow oppositely on the stem. We
find it as an escape from gardens or in waste places near grain
fields.</p>
<p class="genus">(B) <span class="sc">Ragged Robin</span> (<i>Lychnis Flos-cuculi</i>) (<span class="sc">European</span>).
This species, which is also known as Meadow Lychnis, is noteworthy
because of the slashed appearance of its five crimson

The present species was brought to us from Europe. It has
very unusual blossoms, in that the calyx is very inflated, almost
globular and handsomely marked with darker green, so as
to often give it a very similar appearance to that of the citron
melon. The five white petals are cleft in twain for nearly their
whole length.</p>

our adventive members of the Pink family. It increases very
rapidly by means of underground runners as well as by seed.
It is very commonly known as &ldquo;Soapwort,&rdquo; because of the
fact that the mucilaginous juice from the crushed leaves will
form a lather if they are shaken in water; it is said that it was,
in olden days, used for washing purposes.</p>
<p class="genus">The plant stem is quite stout, smooth, erect, and sparingly or
not at all branched. At the top is a corymbed or flat-topped
cluster containing many flowers; petals, notched or sometimes
quite deeply cleft, and with an appendage at the top of the
long claws that, bent at right angles, enter the long, tubular,
veined, greenish, 5-notched calyx.</p>

pointed green pistil, and numerous yellow stamens. The seed-pod
is long and slender.</p>
<p class="genus">The thin, soft leaves are very handsomely divided into three-to
seven-lobed leaflets. Both stem and leaves have a bright
yellow, very acrid juice, that stains everything it comes in contact

as it is supposed to commence flowering with the coming
of the swallows and to cease with their departure. Its generic
name also originated in this belief.</p>

Few plants are as little known generally as this species. It is
one of the most interesting ones that we have. The shapes of
both the leaves and blossoms are clearly shown in the opposite
picture. The pitchers, or basal leaves, may number from three
to a dozen, all radiating from the root and all with the orifice up.
An examination shows that each pitcher is partially filled with
water. Just below the rim of the leaf, on the inside, is a sticky
substance to attract insects; as these enter, they pass downward
over countless little hairs, all pointing downward.
These make it very difficult for insects to crawl out of the
pitcher, and many of them become exhausted and are drowned
in the water. As these insects decompose, they are absorbed
by the plant.</p>

quite erect, branches but little, if at all, and grows from three to
twelve inches tall. The leaves are long-stemmed and trifoliate,
the three leaflets being broadly heart-shaped. They are very
sensitive and close if roughly handled.</p>
<p class="genus">The leaves have very acid and sour juices, similar in taste to
those of the common Red Sorrel that, by the way, belong to
an entirely different family (Buckwheat). Country school
children often chew the leaves of both of these, as the sour

<p class="genus">The bright golden-yellow flowers are quite fragrant; they
open only in the sunshine and close tightly at night. They
grow in few-flowered umbels at the end of the stem on slender

inches. The plant is stemless, that is, the leaf stems and flower
stalks all spring directly from the root.</p>
<p class="genus">The leaves of the common White Violet are rounded heart-shaped
with slightly scalloped or round-toothed edges. It is
very common in swamps and moist woods throughout the
United States and southern Canada.</p>
<p class="genus">(B) <span class="sc">Lance-leaved Violet</span> (<i>Viola lanceolata</i>) is a taller,
more slender species growing from 3 to 8 inches high. Its
leaves are lance-shaped, scallop-edged, and on long stems from
the root. The white flowers are only slightly fragrant; the
three lower petals are strongly veined with purple and the two
side ones are rarely bearded. It is commonly found in swamps
and moist ground from N. S. to Minn. and southward, flowering
from April to June.</p>

<p class="genus"><span class="sc">Downy Yellow Violet</span> (<i>Viola pubescens</i>) is a large, very
handsome Violet that prefers, for its habitat, dry, hilly woods,
often by the side of rushing brooks, but not usually where the
soil is moist.</p>
<p class="genus">The Yellow Violet is one of the tallest members of the family,
its stem ranging from 6 to 18 inches in length. Both the stems
and the leaves are wooly-hairy. There are from two to four
leaves growing from the stem near its summit; they are heart-shaped,
pointed, and either toothed or scalloped. The flowers,
rising on slender peduncles from the axils of the leaves, are
rather large and bright yellow; the two lateral petals are
heavily bearded and the lower one is handsomely veined with
purple. These beards compel visiting insects to brush against
the stigma and then against the anthers before reaching the
nectar in the short spur.</p>
<p class="genus">Most of the Violets, during the summer, have apetalous or
cleistogamous flowers on short peduncles from the root; these
never open, but are fertilized in the bud. Common from N.
S. to Manitoba and southward.</p>

Meadia</i>) is a western species that grows in open woodlands and
on prairies from Pa. to Md. to Manitoba and southward
through the Mississippi Valley.</p>
<p class="genus">The leaves are all in a tuft radiating from the base; they are
oblong, bluntly pointed, and taper into trough-like stems.
From the centre of this cluster of leaves rises a bare flower stalk,
8 to 20 inches tall, branching at the summit into several slender,
curving peduncles, each supporting a single nodding flower.</p>
<p class="genus">The stamens project from the throat of the flower, the five
golden anthers forming a conspicuous cone. Shooting Star
blooms in April and May.</p>
<p class="genus">(B) <span class="sc">Moneywort</span>; <span class="sc">Myrtle</span> (<i>Lysimachia Nummularia</i>)
(<span class="sc">European</span>) is a very dainty and beautiful trailing or creeping
vine, often spreading over large surfaces of ground. It is a
most beautiful plant for rockeries and does well in the house
in hanging pots. The leaves, that grow oppositely all along
the stem, are almost round; it is from their shape and the fact
that they are about the size of the English twopence that they
originally received the name of Moneywort.</p>

<p class="genus"><span class="sc">Fringed Loosestrife</span> (<i>Steironema ciliatum</i>). Fringed
Loosestrife is a very branching herb not at all like the other
varieties. The smooth stem rises to heights of from 12 to 24
inches. The species receives its specific name Fringed
(<i>ciliatum</i>) because of the fine hairs on the upper side of the
leaf stems, the rest of the plant being smooth.</p>
<p class="genus">The smooth light-green leaves are lance-shaped and pointed
on short petioles or stems growing oppositely on the plant
stem. The flowers grow on slender pedicles from the axils
of the terminal leaves; the golden-yellow corolla is divided into
five ovate lobes, each terminating in a sharp, twisted, or
mucronate point; round the centre of the corolla is a reddish-brown
ring, formed by the small spots at the bases of the five
lobes. The pale-green pistil in the centre is surrounded by ten
stamens, five being fertile and the other alternating ones being
abortive.</p>
<p class="genus">Fringed Loosestrife is common in low ground and thickets
from Newfoundland to British Columbia southward to the
Gulf of Mexico.</p>

these blossoms fully expanded, delicate, vase-shaped creations
with four spreading deeply fringed lobes bearing no resemblance
in shape or form to any other American species. The
color is a violet-blue, the color that is most attractive to bumblebees,
and it is to these insects that the flower is indebted for
the setting of its seed. The anthers mature before the stigma
is developed so that self-fertilization is impossible. The

peculiar in their way as those of the Fringed are in theirs. It
is remarkable because the five parts of the corolla never spread;
the flower remains closed. The flowers are cross-fertilized by
the common bumblebee. He knows there is a supply of
nectar at the bottom of each blossom and he has the wits and
the strength to get at it. Slowly but surely he is able to
force the closed lobes apart until his body is half concealed in
the &ldquo;bottle&rdquo;, and he is able to reach the bottom. As he
leaves the flower he is certain to scrape off quantities of pollen
on his head and almost sure to leave some of it on the receptive
stigma of the next flower visited.</p>

<p class="genus">(A) <span class="sc">Tall Blazing Star</span> (<i>Liatris scariosa</i>) is a tall, handsome
perennial that grows in dry situations and attains heights of 2
to 6 feet. A long spike containing numerous, quite large
flower-heads adorns the top of the stem. These heads, which
are about &frac34; in. in diameter, have a very disheveled appearance
for the magenta-purple rays emerge in all directions; they are
contained in a large imbricated involucre. The leaves are stiff,
lanceolate, and closely alternated along the stem. It is found
from Me. to Mich. and southward.</p>
<p class="genus">(B) <span class="sc">Ironweed</span> (<i>Veronia noveboracensis</i>) is a tall (3 to 7 feet)
and smooth-stemmed member of the Composite Family. The
alternating leaves are lanceolate and finely toothed. The
flower-heads are grouped in flat-topped clusters. The rays are
slender and very numerous, giving the heads the appearance of
little <a href="#fCanadaThistle">thistles</a>. This species blooms in August and September,
at which season it is one of the characteristic plants in moist
ground near the seashore.</p>

<p class="genus">(A) <span class="sc">Joe Pye Weed</span> (<i>Eupatorium purpureum</i>) is a very
familiar and pretty species. The simple, rather slender, stem
is very tall, attaining heights of from 2 to 10 feet. The stem
is usually stained purplish and is set at intervals with whorls of
three to six, rough, coarsely toothed leaves; these latter have
short stems, rather broad bases, and are sharp-pointed. The
flowers grow in flat-topped terminal clusters. Each floret is of
a rosy purple color that has projecting styles that give the
flowers a very fuzzy appearance.</p>
<p class="genus">Joe Pye Weed is commonly found in moist places from Newfoundland
to Minn. and southward, flowering during August
and September.</p>
<p class="genus">(B) <span class="sc">Thoroughwort; Boneset</span> (<i>Eupatorium perfoliatum</i>) is
a flowering herb, dearly beloved by the old-fashioned housewife
and equally detested by the small boy. It was, and still is, one
of the most commonly used home remedies. The stem is stout,
hairy, and 1 to 5 feet tall. The opposite leaves are perfoliate,
that is the ends are joined together. It is very common in
swamps or thickets everywhere.</p>

it may be found in profusion in dry sandy places and along
roadsides.</p>
<p class="genus">The flowers grow in rather loose, flat-topped clusters, each
head being on a rather long, slightly sticky peduncle. The
tubular and ray florets proceed from a bell-shaped involucre
composed of overlapping bracts. Its period of bloom is during
August and September and it ranges from N. Y. and Pa. southward
to Fla. and La.</p>
<p class="genus">(B) <span class="sc">Curved-leaved Golden Aster</span> (<i>Chrysopsis falcata</i>)
is a very beautiful species with a silvery, wooly stem, 4 to 10
inches high, closely crowded with stiff, linear, downy, slightly
recurved leaves. The golden-yellow flowers spread about an
inch; the tubular florets in the centre have a brownish orange
tinge but the numerous straps or ray-flowers are the brightest
of orange-yellow. This species loves dry, sandy soil and is most
abundant near the coast from Cape Cod to the pine barrens of
New Jersey. It may be found in bloom from the latter part of
July until September.</p>

<p class="genus"><span class="sc">Smooth Aster</span> (<i>Aster l&aelig;vis</i>) is a handsome species having a
smooth, stout stem, from 2 to 4 feet high. The flowers are in
lovely terminal clusters, each blossom measuring about an inch
across; they are usually light violet-blue in color, although color
is very variable with all the so-called blue asters; each disk is
surrounded by 15 to 30 rays. The leaves are nearly smooth-edged,
lanceolate, clasping the stem with a distinct heart-shaped
base. The Smooth Aster is abundant from Me. to
Minn. and southward, growing in dry soil and blooming in
September and October.</p>
<p class="genus"><span class="sc">New York Aster</span> (<i>Aster novi-belgii</i>) is one of the very

<p class="genus">(A) <span class="sc">Heath Aster</span> (<i>Aster ericoides</i>) is a common white Aster
from Me. to Minn. and southward. The plant grows 1 to 3 feet
tall and has many branches, each having simple, many-flowered
stems racemed along their outer ends. All the stems,
even the flower peduncles, are set with tiny, heath-like, linear
leaves. In our illustration, the apparently different size between
the flowers of this and the last species is because the
scale is different.</p>
<p class="genus">(B) <span class="sc">Many-flowered Aster</span> (<i>Aster multiflorus</i>) has, as its
name would lead one to think, very many flowers, but they are
small, averaging less than &frac12; inch across. In fact, most of the
white-flowered species do have smaller flowers than the blue
ones, but what they lack in size they more than make up in
numbers. The stem is slender but very branching, making a
bush-like plant. Each branch is terminated by short, many-flowered
racemes. The leaves are tiny, light green and linear,
smooth-edged but rough to the touch, crowded along the
branches to their tips. This is a common species from Mass.

<p class="genus">(B) <span class="sc">Sharp-leaved Wood Aster</span> (<i>Aster acuminatus</i>) is a
low-growing woodland Aster growing from 1 to 3 feet in height.
The leaves are quite large, sharply pointed, sharply toothed,
and short stemmed. A few alternate along the lower portions
of the stem and a number are so close together as to appear
whorled about the stem, just below the flowers. The flowers
are few in number, on slender pedicels. They have few white
rays and a rather brownish centre; the rays are long, narrow,
often wavy and give the flower a spread of from 1 to 1&frac12; inches.

during fall. Who has not had the pleasant task of sitting
down and, one by one, removing the little two-hooked, black
seeds that hang so closely to clothing.</p>
<p class="genus">Beggar-ticks, in appearance, is an uninteresting weed common
everywhere in moist ground or along roadsides. The
stem is very branching and is from 1 to 8 feet tall. The leaves
are compounded of three to five sharply toothed, lance-shaped
leaflets. The flower-heads are composed of tubular brownish-yellow
florets, sometimes with no surrounding rays and again
with a few tiny ones.</p>
<p class="genus">(B) <span class="sc">Larger Bur-marigold</span>; <span class="sc">Brook Sunflower</span> (<i>Bidens
l&aelig;vis</i>) is a very attractive species while it is in flower, but later,
after the little seeds have formed, it has the same disagreeable
traits common to all the members of the genus. The flowers
of this species are 1 to 2 in. across, having 8 or 10 large, yellow,
neutral rays surrounding the dull-colored disc florets. The
stem is slender and branching, the leaves lance-shaped and
toothed. Common in swamps and along brooks.</p>

<p class="genus">(A) <span class="sc">Common White Daisy</span>; <span class="sc">Ox-eye Daisy</span> (<i>Chrysanthemum
leucanthemum</i>) (<span class="sc">European</span>) is a naturalized, floral citizen. It
is so common and has become so widespread that it is even better
known than most of our common native flowers.</p>
<p class="genus">This Daisy needs no description. We have two very similar
kinds differing in the shape of the leaves, one being more pinnatifid
than the other. The one shown on the opposite page
is the most common, a variety of <i>leucanthemum</i> called <i>pinnatifidum</i>.
The other variety has the ends of the leaves rounded
and finely toothed but not cut or slashed.</p>
<p class="genus">(B) <span class="sc">Feverfew</span> (<i>Chrysanthemum parthenium</i>) (<span class="sc">European</span>)
is found in some places in the East as an escape from gardens.
The stem grows from 1 to 2 feet tall and is quite branching.
The flowers are grouped in clusters; they are much smaller
than those of the last species and have a comparatively broader
disc of yellow florets. The leaves are broad, deeply pinnatifid,
and each division further toothed or cut. It is locally naturalized
from Mass. to N. J. and westward. It blooms from
June until September, the same as does the last species.</p>

<p class="genus">(A) <span class="sc">Yarrow</span>; <span class="sc">Milfoil</span> (<i>Achillea millefolium</i>) is one of the
most common of our wayside weeds.</p>
<p class="genus">The stem is stout, gray-green, usually simple, or forking near
the top. The leaves, alternating along and clasping the stem,
are soft and feathery&mdash;deeply and finely bipinnatifid.</p>
<p class="genus">The flowers grow in very compact, flat-topped clusters at the
top of the stem. Each flower-head has a centre of short, tubular,
yellowish florets that turn brown or grayish as they grow
old; they are surrounded by from four to six round, white rays.</p>
<p class="genus"><span class="sc">Yarrow</span> is a very hardy plant; we may find it thriving beside
roads where the dust has killed nearly ever other living
thing. Its leaves have a strong, not unpleasant, aromatic
odor.</p>
<p class="genus">(B) <span class="sc">Mayweed</span>; <span class="sc">Chamomile</span> (<i>Anthemis Cotula</i>) (<span class="sc">European</span>)
is also a common weed found by the wayside in company with
the last species. The stem is very branchy, 8 to 20 inches
high. The leaves are very finely divided. The strong, unpleasant
odor of the foliage will at once correct the impression
that it may be a Daisy.</p>

<p class="genus">(A) <span class="sc">Sneezeweed</span> (<i>Helenium autumnale</i>) is a beautiful rather
odd plant that brightens meadows and swamps during August
and September. The stem is rather stout, smooth, and branching;
it ascends from 2 to 6 feet. Alternating along the stem are
numerous ovate, pointed, sharply toothed, bright green leaves.</p>
<p class="genus">It is the blossoms that attract our attention for, besides
being very handsome, they are unusual in form. The hemispherical
centre is composed of closely packed tubular florets
and is surrounded by a number of broad, toothed, golden-yellow
rays; the heads have an expanse of 1 to 2 inches. Both the
tubular and the yellow pistillate rays are fertile.</p>
<p class="genus">(B) <span class="sc">Tansy</span>; <span class="sc">Bitter Buttons</span> (<i>Tanacetum vulgare</i>) (<span class="sc">European</span>)
is abundant everywhere about houses and along roads,
from the Atlantic to the Rocky Mountains.</p>
<p class="genus">The foliage is very bitter and is the foundation of many an
old-fashioned remedy. The flowers grow in flat-topped clusters
and are composed of round discs, or &ldquo;buttons,&rdquo; of tubular
florets only. It is a species not to be mistaken; it has an appearance,
an odor, and a taste of its own. It blooms from July
until September.</p>

and early April, Ragwort shows simply a tuft of stemmed,
heart-shaped leaves, resembling those of <a href="#fCommonViolet">Violets</a>. A little
later a stem ascends from the perennial root; a slender, tough,
angular, twisting stem that finally reaches heights of 1 to 3 feet.
During May and June they carry at their summit a loose
cluster of bright, orange-yellow flowers. Each flower is composed
of but 8 to 12 narrow, orange-yellow rays, surrounding
a central cluster of tubular florets of brownish orange.</p>
<p class="genus">The stem leaves are chiefly sessile, deeply cut or pinnatifid.
Ragwort grows most abundantly and most luxuriantly in
swamps or moist ground, but is also found in dry places or
stony pastures. Its range extends from Newfoundland to
Wisconsin and southward.</p>
<p class="genus">(B) <span class="sc">Arnica</span> (<i>Arnica mollis</i>). The slightly hairy stem grows
from 1 to 2 feet tall. The basal leaves are long petioled but the
stem ones are sessile and opposite, shallow-toothed. At the
summit are one to nine flower-heads on slender peduncles.
About the central disc are 10 to 14 yellow rays, each with three
notches in their ends. Canada and the mountains of northern

<p class="genus"><span id="fBurdock" class="sc">Burdock</span> (<i>Arctium minus</i>) (<span class="sc">European</span>) is a very common
plant on waste ground, along roadsides and the edges of woods.
The plant is often 4 feet or more high. The lower leaves
are very large, often more than a foot in length, heart-shaped,
deep green and finely veined above, grayish beneath because of
the fine wool that covers the under surfaces. The upper leaves
are smaller, more ovate in form, and less densely wooly on the
undersides. The flower-heads grow in clusters at the ends of
the branches. The involucre is almost spherical, composed of
numerous bracts, each terminating in a sharp, hooked point.
Tubular florets, only, are seated within this involucre; they are
purple and white in color, and secrete an abundance of nectar
on which account they are frequented by honey bees.</p>
<p class="genus">The present species adopts the policy of the <a href="#fBeggarTicks">Beggar-ticks</a>, but
instead of single seeds, it attaches the whole bur-like head by
means of its numerous little hooks. They cling tenaciously
to everything they touch; doubtless most of my readers recall
massing these burs together to make castles, funny men, animals,
etc.</p>

perennial species that has strayed across the ocean
and become a pernicious weed.</p>
<p class="genus">The stem is rather slender, branching, and grows from 1 to 3
feet in height. It grows from a perennial, creeping rootstalk,
that is, as farmers have discovered, very difficult to
eradicate from the soil. It grows in extensive colonies and,
unless strenuous efforts are made to destroy them, they very
soon take possession of a field to the exclusion of almost everything
else.</p>
<p class="genus">The leaves, that grow alternately and closely together on the
stem, are long, lance-shaped, deeply cut into sharply prickled
lobes. Numerous flower-heads, about one inch across, terminate
the branches. When in full bloom, the florets vary in
color from rose-purple to white; the involucre is almost globular
and covered with over-lapping bracts, each with a tiny,
sharp, out-turned point.</p>

<p class="genus"><span class="sc">Bull Thistle</span> (<i>Cirsium lanceolatum</i>) is the thistle that we
most often see in fields and pastures. It is one of the largest of
the genus, its heads often measuring 3 inches across. The
stem is stout and simple, and grows from 1 to 3 feet high; it is
hairy and angular in section and grows from a biennial rootstalk.</p>
<p class="genus">The flower-heads are very large, 2 to 3&frac12; inches across and
usually solitary, although frequently two heads grow on the
same stalk. The leaves are lance-shaped, green, clasping,
rather hairy, pinnatifid and armed with short, stout prickles.
Just below the flowers are several small bract-like leaves,
also armed with sharp prickles. All this armor tends to
discourage pilfering insects from crawling up the stem; should
they persist and reach the large involucre, which is also
armed, they will find that, in addition, it is slightly sticky, and
presents an impenetrable barrier to their upward progress.
This species is common from Me. to Del. and Pa. It blooms
from July until September.</p>

bracts; the florets are all tubular and rose-purple.</p>
<p class="genus">This species, which is introduced from Europe, grows in

is a small dandelion, naturalized from Europe and common in
the Eastern States during fall, or from the latter part of July.
The leaves, tufted at the base of the flower scape, are long and
narrow and have blunt teeth. The flower scape is long and
slender and usually forks near the summit, bearing two or
three flower-heads, rarely only one; the scape attains heights of
7 to 18 inches. The flower stalk is not hollow like that of the
common dandelion, but is solid. It grows in fields and along

slender flower scapes rise from these tufts of basal leaves, each
bearing at the summit a little golden-rayed flower resembling

leaves form a staple article of food and can be purchased in
markets in spring at so much per peck. This species, with its
large, flat, rosette of leaves and bright sunny flowers needs no
description; it is well shown on the accompanying plate. All
parts contain a bitter milky juice that exudes freely whenever
the plant is broken.</p>
<p class="genus">The dandelion blooms most abundantly during the spring

forms. Those near the base of the stem are very large, often
attaining lengths of more than a foot. They become smaller
and less deeply lobed as they mount the stem, the upper, small
ones being almost entire edged. The small, yellow-rayed
